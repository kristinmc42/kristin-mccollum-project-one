          <h3>Why I became a blogger</h3>
          <p><em><time datetime="2018-10-08">Monday October 8th, 2018</time> by <strong>Sophie Barlow</strong></em></p>
          <p>Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Wait a minute -
          you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75
          years? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?</p>
          <p>I'll be sure to note that in my log. How long can two people talk about nothing? About four years. I got tired of
          hearing how young I looked. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Wouldn't that
          bring about chaos? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet.</p>
          <p>I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human
          loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your shields were failing,
          sir. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I think
          you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Your head is not an artifact! Commander William Riker of the
          Starship Enterprise. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the
          phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.</p>
          <p>You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the
          hard choice. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion?</p>
          <p>Ensign Babyface! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Your shields were
          failing, sir. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Computer, lights up!
          Talk about going nowhere fast. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.</p>
          <p>I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. What? We're not at all alike! Sorry, Data. In all trust,
          there is the possibility for betrayal. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried
          every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input
          patterns. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Your shields were failing, sir. Fate protects fools, little
          children and ships named Enterprise. The unexpected is our normal routine. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and
          Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Your head is not an artifact! Some days you get the bear, and some days the
          bear gets you. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Commander William Riker of the Starship
          Enterprise.</p>

           <p>Travel time to the nearest starbase? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Fate protects fools, little
           children and ships named Enterprise. Well, that's certainly good to know. The Enterprise computer system is controlled
           by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked.</p>
