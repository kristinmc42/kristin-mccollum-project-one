        <h2>Who is Sophie?</h2>
        <p>Well, that's certainly good to know. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Yes, absolutely, I do
        indeed concur, wholeheartedly! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my
        orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? and attack the Romulans.</p>

          <p>A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Maybe we
          better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Fate protects fools, little children and ships
          named Enterprise.</p>

          <p>Not if I weaken first. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Mr.
          Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Could someone survive inside a
          transporter buffer for 75 years?</p>

          <p>Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. The unexpected is our normal routine. Your head
          is not an artifact! Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full
          investigation. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.</p>

          <p>Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Talk about going nowhere fast. The look
          in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. The unexpected is our normal routine. I am your worst
          nightmare!</p>

          <p>Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! That
          might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. You're going to be an interesting companion,
          Mr. Data.</p>

          <p>Well, that's certainly good to know. Sorry, Data. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Your shields were
          failing, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. We know you're dealing in
          stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf.</p>
